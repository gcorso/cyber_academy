# Cyber Academy

The Internet has brought a radical transformation in every sector in society, including criminality, however, our habits and knowledge haven't kept up with the pace of changes. Cyber Academy helps users to acquire knowledge through a digital platform that offers lessons and quizzes on many aspects of cybersecurity. The app also offers a chat where users can get help from the community and handy tools for their privacy like a password manager.
